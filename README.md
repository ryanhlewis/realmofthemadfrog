Realm of the Mad Frog is a blatant parody of Wild Shadow Studio's Realm of the Mad God.

As with any parody or emulation of work- the goal is obvious. Recreation at my own hands, without the money, motivation, nor equipment professionals would have. Unfortunately, Realm of the Mad Frog became quickly discontinued by my own hand, for reasons I will explain down below.


The whole game concept behind both ROTMF and ROTMG is a 2D character based inside of a top down world, where they move around openly and fight monsters to level up, all the while being within a public lobby and able to do their activities with hundreds of other players and friends.

My first task to emulate was the multiplayer, and I used a pre-existing networking demo to get this done, and programmed in support for a side menu similar to ROTMG, an inventory system, as well as client and server calls for enemy positions, attacks, and player missiles. Let me just say: networking is a pain.

The reason I discontinued this is not because of a lack of motivation- but rather a lack of support from the side of the visual client I was using to put it together: GameMaker. GameMaker Studio 2 does not officially support multiplayer games- and so to simply test if the networking was working properly, I had to compile the game, then run multiple instances of it, take notes, and repeat. This was painstakingly slow, and having to compile 30+ times to ensure something is working is not a job anyone enjoys.

And to make this game, I wanted to enjoy it. This lack of support eroded at my spirits, and I eventually stopped working on the game. However, all 30+ revisions are available on this Github, along with the source code files, if anyone wants to try their own hand. Until GM2 includes support for multiplayer testing, however, I won't be trying again anytime soon.
